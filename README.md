#### How I intended and how it turned out

__Index / Homepage__

![The Index-page on small screen](The_Indexpage_on_small_screen.png)

On the index-page I wanted the User to have the american expereince from the start. which is why I included the american flag and kept in with the red white and blue color theme. I also wanted to make a slideshow to show some of the photos of the diner. While giving the user some text about who there are and also what kind of meals have.
__Reservation Page__

![Gallerypage as imagined](<Gallerypage image.png>) 

![The Gallery Page on a medium sized screen](The_Gallery_page_Medium_size_screen.png)

I wanted to make the reservation page as simpleas possible. Which is why it just has the form and a photo of the diner to keep it simple for the user 

__Contact page__

On the contact page, the User finds my email and my phonenumber, along with the address and a google map to show where it is Again wanted to keep it simple with a image of the diner interior in the background 



- __Navigation Bar__

![navbar](navigation.png)

Our full responsive navigation bar ensures smooth navigation across all pages. Here’s how it works:

1. Consistent Links: Whether you’re on the Home page, Gallery, or Contact page, the navigation bar remains identical. You’ll find direct links to each section, making it easy to switch between pages.
   
2. Mobile-Friendly: When the screen size is smaller than 768px, the navigation bar transforms into a compact bar icon. This space-saving design ensures a seamless experience even on smaller screens.

## Testing
