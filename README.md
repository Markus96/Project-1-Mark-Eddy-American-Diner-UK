I have a bug where for some reason the contact page would work with the CSS style sheet. After many hours of making sure it was calling for the right directory. I restarted Github enterprise and it is now working. I have tested this again and whatever happened is not happening again. so the issue must have been with github enterprise.

## Deployment
