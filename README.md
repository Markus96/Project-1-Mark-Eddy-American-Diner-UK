## Features User Experience
#### How I intended and how it turned out

__Index / Homepage__

![Indexpage as imagined](<Index page wire frame.PNG>) 

![The Index-page on small screen](<Index Page desktop.PNG>)

On the index-page I wanted the User to have the american expereince from the start. which is why I included the american flag and kept in with the red white and blue color theme. I also wanted to make a slideshow to show some of the photos of the diner. While giving the user some text about who there are and also what kind of meals have.

__Reservation Page__

![Reservation Page](<Reservation page wire frame.PNG>)

__Contact page__

- __Navigation Bar__


Our full responsive navigation bar ensures smooth navigation across all pages. Here’s how it works:

1. Consistent Links: Whether you’re on the Home page, Gallery, or Contact page, the navigation bar remains identical. You’ll find direct links to each section, making it easy to switch between pages.
   
2. Mobile-Friendly: When the screen size is smaller than 768px, the navigation bar transforms into a compact bar icon. This space-saving design ensures a seamless experience even on smaller screens.
